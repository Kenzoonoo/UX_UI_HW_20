                <h5>Stakeholder Interviews</h5>
                <p>We started by setting up and interviewing two of the board members for Dogs Of A Good Society and organized the notes into an affinity diagram. This helped us understand what their main priorities and pain points were. Some of their pain points included users not knowing that they help more than just dogs and that their assistance form is an external link to google and they would prefer it to be in-house.  From there, we created a proto persona to help us get an understanding of what our assumptions may be in regards to the users.</p>

Based on the empathy mapping session, we did some feature prioritization work to determine which areas we wanted to tackle based on feasibility, the stakeholder input, and what we learned from the user interviews. </p>

                <p>We created two high fidelity versions for the AB testing. The main difference between them is how we labeled the assistance form and the image we used, with all of the users preferring the B version, which had the assistance application labeled and an image of a veterinarian. We also put in a carousel image on the hero banner with images of the president’s dogs, but also put in images of cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs, to indicate it wasn’t just an organization that helped dogs, despite the name of the org.
